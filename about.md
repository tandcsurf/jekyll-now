I'm a self-taught software engineer. I love using React and Express, alongside Redux and Firebase/PostGres when needed. Right now I'm building personal projects while hunting down work.

This is a technical blog, used to document myself turning the confusion and bewilderment of broken code and yucky, unfamiliar situations into something that works.
